      "Answer: As an academic, you can visit the UK for up to 6 months to do research. If you're doing a distance learning course, your course can last longer than 6 months as most of your study will happen outside of the UK. You can also visit to do certain activities as part of your course. Before visiting, you must prove certain conditions, although these conditions are not specified in the provided context. If you are an academic, but not a senior doctor or dentist, you must also prove you're visiting to do research or a formal exchange. If you're a senior doctor or dentist, you must also prove you're visiting to do research, clinical practice, a formal exchange or to teach. In some cases, you may need to get an Academic Technology Approval Scheme (ATAS) certificate before you start your course or research, especially if you're researching certain subjects at postgraduate level or above.\n"
